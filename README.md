Objective:
The Student Grade Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing and analyzing student grades across multiple subjects. It allows users to input individual subject grades and automatically calculates key performance indicators including average grades, letter grades, and GPA. The system provides a user-friendly interface for teachers or administrators to quickly process student data and generate comprehensive grade reports. It implements standardized grading scales and GPA calculations to ensure consistent evaluation across all subjects. The program outputs a formatted grade report that presents all relevant academic performance metrics in a clear and organized manner.
Key Activities:

Collection of student information and subject-wise grades through interactive input prompts, allowing for dynamic entry of multiple subjects and their corresponding scores.
Processing of numerical grades using specialized functions to calculate average scores, determine letter grades based on predefined grade boundaries, and compute GPA using standard 4.0 scale conversion.
Generation of a comprehensive grade report that displays the student's name, calculated average grade, assigned letter grade, and final GPA in a well-formatted output structure.

Technologies Used:

Python: Core programming language used for implementing the grade calculation logic, user input handling, and output formatting functionality.
Google Colab: Cloud-based development environment providing an interactive platform for code execution and testing with built-in support for Python programming.
